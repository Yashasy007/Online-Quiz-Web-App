The primary objective of this project was to design a robust online quiz application that facilitates the creation, administration, and evaluation of quizzes. The scope included developing a web-based interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with a backend powered by Python-Flask for server-side operations. The methodology involved a systematic approach to software development, including requirements gathering, system design, implementation, and testing. Key specifications included user authentication, real-time score tracking, and a responsive design to ensure compatibility across devices. The project adhered to Agile principles, allowing for iterative development and continuous improvement based on user feedback.

The outcomes of the project demonstrated significant improvements in user engagement and assessment efficiency. The application successfully handled multiple concurrent users, with an average response time of under two seconds. User testing indicated a satisfaction rate of over 85%, highlighting the effectiveness of the interactive features. Additionally, the application provided comprehensive analytics for educators, enabling them to track student performance and identify areas for improvement. Overall, the project not only met its objectives but also contributed valuable insights into the potential of online assessments in modern education.
